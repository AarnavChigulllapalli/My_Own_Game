Elements of game designing:
1)Characters(PC&NPC)
PC-2
NPC-3(Teleport Pad, Obstacles, Turbo)
2)Story-
	A race is between 2 people for $1M. They have to cross the finish line first. There are two things that can help you teleport pad and turbo to 
help you cross the finish line first. Just before the race was about to start your opponent added obstacles on the course making the race harder.
3)Goal-
Cross the finish line first
4)Rules-
i)You lose if the opponent crosses the finish line before you
ii)The obstacles will lower the speed of your car
iii)The teleport pad will teleport you to the next checkpoint
iv)The turbo increases the speed of your car
5)Balance-
The obstacles decrease your speed by 20 and turbo increases your speed by 10 and teleport pad will teleport you ahead
6)Adaptivity-After every ckeckpoint there will be more obstacles and less turbo and teleport pads
7)Chance Vs Skill- NPC have a chance of spwaning where they have spawned and to move the car you will use WASD.
8)Feedback-If you lose there will be a Sweet-Alert message and if you win there will be winning music and Sweet-Alert message
